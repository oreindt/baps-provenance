data model
----------

* which parameters to fit?

* which data, how to use?
	* arrivals			delta over time			fit model against
	* mortality 		% relative to arrivals	use directly

	* presence			delta over time			fit model against
	* frontex			use * factor => interc	fit factor (see parameters)
	* NGOs				use * factor => arrival	fit factor (see parameters)

* summary statistics
	* what to compare?
		* delta arrivals per year
		* death rate per year
		* delta presence per year
		* delta interceptions per year
		* 
	* implement

* interceptions?
	* TODO? currently death rate is ignored for this
		

* waiting?
	* should waiting be included?
	* if so, how?

* return/abort?
	* not for now, I think

* resources/quality?
	set all equal for now

info
----

* different trust levels dependent on source
* broadcast info on risk


* rename friction in info/location (keeps confusing me)

* motivated false info (?)

* forget contacts
	- by success (remaining capital)

* communicate routes

* info exchange by interestingness/relevance?
	- more capital => higher authority?
